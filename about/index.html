<h2>About this website</h2>
<ul>
	<li>This website was made with love, lots of head scratching, trials, and errors. But mostly it was made possible through <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>.</li>
	<li>All images are mine, except for those that aren't which to the best of my poor endeavour are all properly cited and linked to their respective owners.</li>
	<li><strong>In the spirit of responsibility:</strong> I am responsible for content on this website, but not to the content of those that I link to, except for those links whose contents are my responsibility as well.</li>
	<li>All links are ensured to be accurate (live) as of the time of writing. Some efforts, i.e., when I feel like it, are made to update them, but be not assured of their longevity.</li>
	<li>Filler text used in the examples were taken from The Essays by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon" target="_blank">Sir Francis Bacon</a> from <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/575" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fa-mar.github.io%2F" target="_blank">Validation</a></li>
	<li>The logo (aka the twirling a's) were made from combining four twirling <a title ="Source Serif Pro" href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-serif-pro" target="_blank">Source Serif Pro Light</a>, and four twirling <a title="Charter" href="http://practicaltypography.com/charter.html" target="_blank">Charter Bold Italic</a> in <a title="Photoshop 7" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop_version_history#7.0">Photoshop 7</a>.</li>

<h2>About the author</h2>
<p>The greater part of my life, which as of late has already passed the quarter-century mark, was spent at school.</p>
